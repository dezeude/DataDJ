# DataDJ
This project is a tool that allows you to visualize data using physical external hardware devices. Instead of having to rewrite a Python, MATLAB, or R (etc.) command you can use this tool to view data and visualize changes in its parameters in real time. Data DJ works best when you precompute the data in another program.
